# Welcome to the GitHub repository for my website!

My live website needs a glow-up, so I am teaching myself React to make it nicer.  It's still in the works, but if you want to see a preview, just follow these nice, easy steps:

1. Ensure you have node.js and npm installed.  I am developing on Node version 20.13.1.
2. Clone the repository wherever you like.
3. Open a terminal in the repository root and run `npm install`.
4. In the same directory, run `npm run dev`.  The website will be available at http://localhost:5173/.
